Hi! Welcome to umd.io. If you want to use University of Maryland data in your app, project, or program, you’re in the right place. This documentation will walk you through the basics of using the api and provide detailed information about all supported API calls.

We are a GETful API. That means that we follow RESTful conventions, but you can only get data from the server (via an http get request), but you can’t create, update, or destroy data.

The API is in version 0. That means that we are adding, changing, and breaking things all the time. Contact the team or create an issue on github if something isn’t working the way it should. If you subscribe to updates, we’ll let you know when cool new data is added and when we make big changes.

**tl;dr**: We’ll try our best not to break your app, but until we release v1.0, no promises!
