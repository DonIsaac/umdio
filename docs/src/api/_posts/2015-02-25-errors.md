200 - OK	Everything worked as expected. If you aren’t getting the result you expected, it might mean that the data you are trying to access doesn’t actually exist in the database.

```
get ’http://api.umd.io/v0/courses/ENGL101’ works as expected
get ‘http://api.umd.io/v0/courses/ENGL115’ returns empty, because that’s not a class. If your app thinks it’ll get a real response here, it’ll break.
```

400 - Bad Request	This means that the url in your request couldn’t possibly match anything in the api, probably because of a misspelling. 

```
get ‘http://api.umd.io/v0/courses/ene10’ returns a 400 error, because ‘ene’ is only 3 letters and ‘10’ is only two digits, so there is no way it could be a proper request.
```

404 - Not Found	The requested url doesn't exist. This happens when the url isn’t anything on our end, not even a badly formed request. 

```
get ‘http://blargyblarg.umd.io’
get ‘http://api.umd.io/v5/courses’ (we’re not even up to version 1 yet!)
get ‘http://api.umd.io/courses’  you need to specify a version number!
get ‘http://api.umd.io/v0/course’ ‘course’ isn’t an endpoint, so you get a 404
```

500, 502, 503, 504 - Internal Server Errors.	Something went wrong on our end. We try not to send you this. If you get one, let us know, and send us all you can about the circumstances of your error.
