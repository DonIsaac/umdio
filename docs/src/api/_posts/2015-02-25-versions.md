When we release a new version of the API that’s not backwards-compatible, the version you request in the url will change. That means that ‘/v0/courses’ might be very different than ‘/v1/courses’. 

So that your app doesn’t break when we update the version, every request needs to specify the version number right in the url. If you leave out the ‘/v0’ or ‘/v1’, or you’ll get a bad response.

<!-- EXAMPLE -->

The current version is live at:

```
http://api.umd.io/v0
```
